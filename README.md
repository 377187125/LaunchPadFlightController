This is a flight controller used for a quadcopter in X-configuration.

It is written for the [Tiva C Series TM4C123G LaunchPad](http://www.ti.com/tool/EK-TM4C123GXL).

In order to built this project you need to download Keil ÂµVision IDE 4. Then open the [project file](LaunchPadFlightController.uvproj).

The code is still in progress. I will update this readme with more information later on.
